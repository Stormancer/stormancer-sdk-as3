# stormancer-sdk-as3
Stormancer client SDK and samples to connect an actionscript 3 application to a Stormancer server

Currently a work in progress. This version can connect to a Stormancer server, connect to it and retrieve scenes, but not yet send data to or receive data from it.

Debugging is under way to provide a fully functionnal library soon...
